# pikmin time!

This is a little web "app" (well, as of right now, a static site with no backend) I made to get more familiar with bundlers and maintaining web apps with the same kind of tooling I would use in my previous roles, and also serve as a sandbox for me to bridge the gaps in my knowledge around:

- Functional components in React
- SCSS functions and mixins
- ESLint rules
- Setting up unit test suites with jest
- HTML pseudoelements and using funky CSS rules with them
- Maintaining a cleaner git history -- I want to get much more comfortable with interactive rebasing, patches + hunks, and just extra nitty gritty git (gitty?) details.

Currently, this code is not hosted anywhere, and the only way to view the site is to download the repository and running

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

in the terminal.

The repository was initially built with Create React App, and then migrated over to the Vite framework at around Sept 2024.
